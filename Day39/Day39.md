# Todo 

### 1. Animation 

### Create a reflection of the sun in the water.
### Add the ability to press to reverse the sunset scene while it is still happening. So if your user presses the scene while the sun is halfway down, it will go right back up again seamlessly. Likewise, if your user presses the scene while transitioning to night, it will smoothly transition right back to a sunrise.
