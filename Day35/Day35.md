### 1. Adding Swipe to Dismiss

You will add swipe-to-dismiss functionality to make better user experience.
Implementing swipe to dismiss will allow a user to delete a crime with a single swipe to the right.

To get swipe to dismiss set up with CrimeListFragment's RecyclerView, wire up an ItemTouchHelper. ItemTouchHelper provides a swipe-to-dismiss implementation and is included with the RecyclerView support library.
